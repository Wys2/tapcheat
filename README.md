# Tap'Cheat

> Tap'Cheat is a cheat made in Js, Using NodeJs with Puppeteer
*I KNOW !* It is absolutely inefiscient, and very badly coded.
This might be my worst project. I didn't put any effort, it was just a project I made because I was bored during few hours...

## Installation

1. Install NodeJs on [NodeJs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Download the source code
3. In your directory, execute `npm i`
4. Configure your .env
5. Run using `node .`
